## 🚀 How to Run This Project

You can run this dashboard in two ways: on your local machine or directly in Google Colab.

###  Method 1: Running on Your Local Machine (Recommended)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Streamlit-Sales-Dashboard.git](https://github.com/your-username/Streamlit-Sales-Dashboard.git)
    cd Streamlit-Sales-Dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your browser should automatically open a new tab with the running dashboard.

### ### Method 2: Running in Google Colab

This method requires a free `ngrok` account to create a public URL for your dashboard.

1.  **Upload Files:** Open a new Google Colab notebook and upload the `app.py` script and the `supermarket_sales.csv` dataset to the file browser.

2.  **Install Libraries:** In a code cell, install the necessary libraries.
    ```python
    !pip install streamlit pandas plotly-express pyngrok
    ```

3.  **Get Your ngrok Authtoken:**
    * Go to the [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) and sign up for a free account.
    * Copy your unique authtoken from the dashboard.

4.  **Run the App:** In a new code cell, paste the following code. Replace the placeholder with your actual `ngrok` authtoken, then run the cell.

    ```python
    from pyngrok import ngrok

    # Paste your ngrok authtoken here
    NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN = "YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN_GOES_HERE"
    ngrok.set_auth_token(NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN)

    # Run the streamlit app in the background
    !streamlit run app.py &>/dev/null &

    # Open a tunnel to the streamlit port and get the public URL
    public_url = ngrok.connect(8501)
    print("Click the link to view your dashboard:")
    print(public_url)
    ```
